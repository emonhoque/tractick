## ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Ready

The codebase has been cleaned and optimized for production deployment. All development artifacts have been removed while maintaining full functionality.

### Key Optimizations Applied:
- Console statements stripped by Terser
- Source maps disabled
- Code minified and optimized
- Development comments removed
- Environment variables configured
- Build scripts created

### Next Steps:
